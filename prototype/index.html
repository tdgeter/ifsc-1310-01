      <h2>Athletics</h2>

      <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Baseball</li>
        <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
        <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
        <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
        <li>Women's Soccer</li>
        <li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
        <li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
        <li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
        <li>Men's wrestling</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</p>

      <p>Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.</p>

      <p>A notable athlete from UALR Atheletics is Derek Fisher who was awarded a Honorary Doctoral from UALR in 2015.
      <blockquote> "I want to tell you first-hand, that whatever it is that you imagine you can be, it is absolutely possible. I'm proof, and there are many people sitting in this room who are proof, that right here at UALR everything you want to be can be accomplished. But you're the driver." <cite>Derek Fisher during his Honorary Doctoral acceptance Speech. <sup><a href="#citation">[5]</a></sup> </cite></blockquote> A five-time world champion, Fisher has played in (259) and won (161) more NBA playoff games than any player in league history. He served as president of the NBA Players Association from 2006-13 and played a pivotal role in ending the 2011 NBA lockout.</p>

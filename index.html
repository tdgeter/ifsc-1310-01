        <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          In all honesty, I had never once really given any thought into
          "Accessibility", even though I have unknowingly benifited from it
          before. Although I am not disabled in any way, I can distinctly
          remember times where my wireless mouse died to my desktop, and I had
          to use the keyboard to navigate my computer. At the time, I had no
          idea that features like this were specifically implemented in an
          effort to make the comptuer as accessible as possible to any and all.
          Now that I have begun learning about web development, I have a new
          found appreciation for accessibility. It is not something that gets
          implemented by happenstance, but instead by series of very thoughtful
          decisions about how we intend for our website and applications to be
          utilized. In <em> Accessibility for the Modern Web </em> by Derek
          Featherstone, Featherstone mentions that accessibility is not
          something that is intended to increase user experience, but instead
          something allows users to <strong>have</strong> an experience at all.
          Out of the entire lecture, this has stuck with me the most and will be
          something I try and be very mindful of with any work I do in the
          future!

        <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p>
          From my understanding, progressive enhancement is all about ensuring that your project is built from a rock solid foundation before you begin slowly improving it with the addition of styles and functionality. The article compares progressive enhancement to a Peanut M&M, however the construction of a new building is what comes to my mind as someone who comes from the construction industry. When a new construction project is awarded, there is typically a beautifully rendered 3D model of what the new building is supposed to look like, and all of the nice finishes that it will have upon completion. Despite this, when we arrive to the job site, all we have is a set of drawings/specifications and a barren lot. In order to ensure that we can ever come close to the rendered images of our building, we have to first place a solid concrete foundation. This type of construction is typically called "Vertical Construction", as there is an emphasis on the idea of progressively building from the solid foundation and up. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To me, these 2 ideas go hand and hand. Just as we would never start painting walls of a building before all of our concrete foundation was placed, someone in web development should be mindful to ensure that their content is structured appropriately before ever thinking about adding CSS or JavaScript. This ensures that as you go from working HTML, to CSS, and eventually to JavaScript that each previous step is completed to a point that it can stand entirely on its own. Working in such a way will produce an end product that is fully realized and cohesive. In construction, this means that you have built a building that will be usable by the customer for many years to come. In web development, this means that you have made a website that is accessible and usable by anyone, regardless of their device or browser.

        <h3>Final Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          After the completion of my Final Project first draft, I requested some criticism from my wife. I asked that she open my website, and try to navigate it as she would any other website. In addition, I requested that she give me some input on the overall design of each page. One of the first comments she made related to the title of the main page. She did not feel like there was a clear, pronounced title for the page. She also made note of how weird the table looked for the recent missions displayed on the history page. One of the last design comments she made related to the overall lack of pictures on the site. While watching her navigate the site, I noticed that she went to go back to the main page and kind of froze for a second as she looked for the correct spot to click. In my first draft, I had only included a link to the homepage through the logo. However, seeing her pause before thinking to check the logo made me realize that I needed a dedicated Home button listed with the rest of my navigation options.
        </p>

        <p>To address these concerns she brought up to me, I am going to make sure to make my title block on the main page more pronounced by centering it and adding some additional size/styling to the text. I will also be adjusting the style of my table to make it more readable, and give it a more cohesive design. Finally, I will be adding some photos and also including a home button on every page.
        </p>

        <p>This project has challenged my understanding of what it means for a website to be intuitive and accessible. During the course, we have talked about accessibility, and building websites that are useable and those conversations opened my eyes to the ideas. However, witnessing someone get lost on my own site based on design choices I had made really drove home the point. I have been an active user of the web from a young age, so there are many things about websites that feel natural to me. From a design perspective, this meant that I would make decisions based on my own perspective and comfortableness. Yet, when my wife went to use my website there were design choices I made that did not quite match her intuition or expectation for how a website should behave.
        </p>

        <p>This course has shown me that I am more capable than I thought when we began months ago. I feel like I have a decent grasp on how to structure my html, and style the site using the resources given to us during the course. Yet, if I was given the chance to start over, I would want it to be with this new found perspective of always ensuring that your website is as accessible and user friendly as possible. I have enjoyed my time in the course, and look forward to utilizing everything you have taught us this semester!

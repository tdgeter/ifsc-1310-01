  <h3> Thoughts on Web Accessibility </h3>
  <p>In all honesty, I had never once really given any thought into "Accessibility", even though I have unknowingly benifited from it before. Although I am not disabled in any way, I can distinctly remember times where my wireless mouse died to my desktop, and I had to use the keyboard to navigate my computer. At the time, I had no idea that features like this were specifically implemented in an effort to make the comptuer as accessible as possible to any and all. Now that I have begun learning about web development, I have a new found appreciation for accessibility. It is not something that gets implemented by happenstance, but instead by series of very thoughtful decisions about how we intend for our website and applications to be utilized. In <em> Accessibility for the Modern Web </em> by Derek Featherstone, Featherstone mentions that accessibility is not something that is intended to increase user experience, but instead something allows users to <strong>have</strong> an experience at all. Out of the entire lecture, this has stuck with me the most and will be something I try and be very mindful of with any work I do in the future! </p>

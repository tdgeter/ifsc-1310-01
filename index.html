        <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          In all honesty, I had never once really given any thought into
          "Accessibility", even though I have unknowingly benifited from it
          before. Although I am not disabled in any way, I can distinctly
          remember times where my wireless mouse died to my desktop, and I had
          to use the keyboard to navigate my computer. At the time, I had no
          idea that features like this were specifically implemented in an
          effort to make the comptuer as accessible as possible to any and all.
          Now that I have begun learning about web development, I have a new
          found appreciation for accessibility. It is not something that gets
          implemented by happenstance, but instead by series of very thoughtful
          decisions about how we intend for our website and applications to be
          utilized. In <em> Accessibility for the Modern Web </em> by Derek
          Featherstone, Featherstone mentions that accessibility is not
          something that is intended to increase user experience, but instead
          something allows users to <strong>have</strong> an experience at all.
          Out of the entire lecture, this has stuck with me the most and will be
          something I try and be very mindful of with any work I do in the
          future!
